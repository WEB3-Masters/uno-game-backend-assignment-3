# UNO Game Backend

This is the backend for the UNO game. It is written in TypeScript and uses Express.js for the server and WebSockets for the communication between the server and the clients.

To run the backend, you need to have Node.js installed. You can install it from [here](https://nodejs.org/).

After you have installed Node.js, you can run the following commands to start the server:

```bash
npm install
```

When the installation is done, you can start the server with:

```bash
tsx src/server.ts
```

The server will start on port 3000. You can change the port in the `src/server.ts` file.

To verify that the server is running, you can open the following URL in your browser: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
